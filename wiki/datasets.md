# Datasets

This is a place to share information about open source weather and climate data sets, as well as tips and resources on how to use them

## Copernicus

This was kindly shared by an OU tutor for our club members on the Maths and Stats forums:

*Something that might be of interest to this club is the Copernicus Climate Data Store*

*This is an enormous data repository of observations, reanalysis and projections for global weather and climate.  There is so much information, it is a challenge to find one's way around, and beware that any dataset you download may be huge.  There are interactive representations of key data to explore.  With some programming experience, you can produce plots and process information yourself online. And it is free to use.  (A student of mine used it last year.)*

Note: In September 2024 the Copernicus Climate Data Store will be migrating infrastructure to [https://cds-beta.climate.copernicus.eu](https://cds-beta.climate.copernicus.eu), and this will require an ECMWF account for access. This page has more information on ECMWF public access: [https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/accessing-forecasts](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/accessing-forecasts)

The [Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu) is another Copernicus dataset that has really helpful user guide videos in its dedicated [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@copernicusdataspaceecosystem/videos).

There are a lot of resources to support anyone wishing to get started - this EUMETSAT guide lists them all:

[https://user.eumetsat.int/resources/user-guides/getting-started-using-data](https://user.eumetsat.int/resources/user-guides/getting-started-using-data)

The resources listed there include this [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqoetylQAIY&list=PLOQg9n6Apif2Qw_gLhwzhJb3XUoAiUkoq) where a series of videos covers

- How to access satellite data from EUMETSAT and the missions it operates as part of the Copernicus programme
  
- Basics of working with different types of data, including ocean colour, SST and altimetry
