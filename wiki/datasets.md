## Copernicus

This was kindly shared by an OU tutor for our club members on the Maths and Stats forums

*Something that might be of interest to this club is the Copernicus Climate Data Store*

[https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/#!/home](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/#!/home)

*This is an enormous data repository of observations, reanalysis and projections for global weather and climate.  There is so much information, it is a challenge to find one's way around, and beware that any dataset you download may be huge.  There are interactive representations of key data to explore.  With some programming experience, you can produce plots and process information yourself online. And it is free to use.  (A student of mine used it last year.)*
