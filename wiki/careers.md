## ðŸ“Œ Getting Started

The Royal Meteorological Society has just published a really nice guide to ['Careers for Climate'](https://www.rmets.org/careers-climate) - it's full of interesting interviews with people across all disciplines and roles, and helpful tips too.

The Royal Meteorological Society are the UK's Professional and Learned Society for weather and climate and offer extensive student and early careers support through their programme of events and membership benefits: [RMetS Student and Early Careers](https://www.rmets.org/membership/information-for-students)

## ðŸ“ŒJob Alerts

If you are a beginner, job postings have a lot of interesting information about current groups and active interests and might help you get a feel for what interests you.

In a discord server, we have set up a dedicated channel for vacancies via RSS feed: if you would like to set up a customised jobs email alert for yourself, top tips are [RMetS Jobs](https://jobs.rmets.org/), [jobs.ac.uk](https://www.jobs.ac.uk/) and [Indeed](https://uk.indeed.com/). For listings in the renewable energy sector, [Rejobs](https://rejobs.org/en) is a great place to look, set up by a recent OU Environmental Sciences graduate.
