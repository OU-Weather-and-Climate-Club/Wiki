**Idea in progress**: setting up a wiki to organise and share the resources suggested by our club members

The wiki is a club activity open to all club members; and especially for beginners, a great way to practise version control, GitHub actions and collaborative writing in a supportive environment.

***

At the moment we are figuring out whether we are happy with this wiki template:
In theory, it could help us build a wiki with the functionalities shown in this [website demo](https://www.drassil.org/git-wiki/main_page)

This repo was forked from [git-wiki-skeleton](https://github.com/Drassil/git-wiki-skeleton)

For the template's documentation, installation guide and demo of git-wiki-theme visit [this page](http://drassil.github.io/git-wiki/)

Tasks To-Do List:

- [ ] Explore and understand the template
- [ ] Decide how resources should be organised 
- [ ] Write documentation explaining how to contribute
- [ ] Connect/transfer resources suggested in Discord
